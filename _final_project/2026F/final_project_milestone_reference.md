# Final Project — Milestone Reference (Fall 2026, QM47400)

**Single source of truth for the Fall 2026 Final Project milestone numbering, due dates, and grading.** Every other document (`syllabus.qmd`, `schedule.qmd`, the planning docs, the individual milestone instruction files in this folder, and the project-related notebooks) must be kept consistent with this file. Update it first whenever the project structure changes.

> **Precedence.** This file is reconciled against the **live Brightspace course**, which is what students actually see and submit against. Where this file and Brightspace disagree, Brightspace wins and this file is corrected. Last reconciled **2026-08-20** against the Brightspace export of 2026-08-18 (see [`../../_project_docs/BRIGHTSPACE_INVENTORY_2026F.md`](../../_project_docs/BRIGHTSPACE_INVENTORY_2026F.md)).

### Templates and rubrics (this folder)

| File | Used by |
|---|---|
| [`template/qm474_poster_template.pptx`](template/qm474_poster_template.pptx) | M09 poster first draft, M10 final poster |
| [`rubric/Predictive_Analytics_Poster_Rubric.pdf`](rubric/Predictive_Analytics_Poster_Rubric.pdf) (also `.docx`, `.xlsx`) | M09, M10, and the Instructor/TA evaluation |
| [`template/QM474_group_contract.docx`](template/QM474_group_contract.docx) | M00 group contract; rebuilt by `scripts/build_group_contract_docx.py` |

The poster template and rubric are carried forward unchanged from the 2026Summer offering; only the template filename changed, from `mgmt474_poster_template.pptx` to `qm474_poster_template.pptx`, to match the current course code.

> **Milestone numbering.** The track runs **M00 through M13 with no gaps**. Every number is used. (An earlier version of this file stated that M04, M07, and M13 were unused this term; that was wrong. All three are live in Brightspace and carry the instructor/TA meeting schedule-and-confirm cycle.)

> **Notebook vs. milestone numbering.** The course notebooks refer to a simplified "M1–M4" project track (e.g., nb05 proposal, nb09 baseline). Those are *skill* checkpoints inside the notebooks; the **official deliverables and deadlines are the M00–M13 milestones in this document**. Where a notebook says "M3," map it to the official milestone by topic (complex model → **M08**; draft abstract → **M03**).

## The Final Project at a glance

In the same group, students complete a practical predictive analytics project culminating in a final research poster. **Presentation of the poster at the Fall 2026 Purdue Undergraduate Research Conference on Tuesday, November 17, 2026, is required for all students**, and the final poster is due one week before the conference, on **Tuesday, November 10, 2026**. Professor Moreira serves as faculty mentor throughout the process.

The Final Project is worth **35% of the course grade**, assessed as follows.

| # | Component | Share of project | Share of course | What it covers |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | **Milestone Deliverables** | 30% | 10.5% | Incremental project components submitted on specific due dates. These allow for early feedback and ensure steady progress throughout the semester. Grades reflect each milestone's clarity, completeness, and timely submission. |
| 2 | **Peer Evaluation** | 20% | 7.0% | Students evaluate their peers' contributions, encouraging accountability and productive teamwork. These assessments help ensure balanced participation and measure collaborative effectiveness. |
| 3 | **Peer Review** | 10% | 3.5% | Each group reviews and provides constructive feedback on other teams' posters. This encourages engagement, enhances critical analysis skills, and promotes a culture of constructive critique. |
| 4 | **Poster Presentation at the Conference** | 20% | 7.0% | A poster template and assessment rubric are shared. Final posters are submitted by the syllabus due date, after which they are printed and distributed during a dedicated Poster Presentation Preparation class. |
| 5 | **Instructor / TA Evaluation** | 20% | 7.0% | After the Undergraduate Research Conference, the instructor and the TA evaluate the final submission against a rubric that is shared in advance. |
| | **Total** | **100%** | **35.0%** | |

Students are encouraged to review previous award-winning student posters for inspiration: <https://davi-moreira.github.io/applied_projects.html>. Additional details on the conference: <https://www.purdue.edu/undergrad-research/conferences/index.php>.

As the conference may not coincide with the regular class time, students should communicate with their other instructors in advance regarding potential scheduling conflicts. **The usual class immediately following the Poster Presentation is not held**, allowing time to rest and catch up on other coursework.

**Poster-to-Product** is a separate **5%** of the course grade: the post-conference, two-week in-class build sprint that converts the validated model into a stakeholder-ready dashboard or app plus an executive brief, with the showcase on Wed Dec 9. Graded 80% on deliverables and showcase (NACE competencies: Technology, Teamwork, Communication, Critical Thinking) and 20% on intra-group peer evaluation.

| — | **Peer Evaluation Submission** | **Fri Dec 11** | Dec 7 – Dec 11 | 20% of project |

The Peer Evaluation Submission is filed under its own Brightspace category (it also covers the Course Case Competition), which is why it sits outside the Final Project block above.

### The meeting cycle

Four of the sixteen items are the instructor/TA meeting cycle, which runs in two rounds. Each round is **scheduled** in one milestone and **confirmed** in a later one:

| Round | Schedule the meetings | Meeting windows | Confirm they happened |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Round 01** | **M00** (due Sep 20) | TA: Sep 21 – Oct 4 · Instructor: Oct 5 – Oct 11 | **M04** (due Oct 11) |
| **Round 02** | **M07** (due Oct 18) | TA: Oct 19 – Nov 1 · Instructor: Nov 2 – Nov 7 | **M13** (due Nov 15) |

At least one member of the group must attend each meeting; it need not be the same member every time. Round 01 focuses on the prediction problem, the data, and the proposed modeling strategy. Round 02 focuses on the predictive models, the modeling strategy, and poster development.

> **Round 01 windows are inferred**, derived from the M00 submission deadline and the M04 confirmation deadline to mirror the structure Round 02 states explicitly. Confirm or correct them before publishing M00 and M04 to students.
