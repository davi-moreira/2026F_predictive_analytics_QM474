# Discrepancy Register — Fall 2026 (QM 47400)

Every known contradiction across the course's artifacts, consolidated in one place as of
**2026-08-20**. Sources reconciled: the live Brightspace export (2026-08-18), the official syllabus
docx, `syllabus.qmd`, `schedule.qmd`, `_project_docs/`, `_final_project/2026F/`, `_quizzes/`, the
announcement drafts, and the private task tracker.

**Severity:** 🔴 high (students see it, or it corrupts a source of truth) · 🟡 medium · ⚪ low ·
✅ resolved.

**Precedence when two artifacts disagree:** the official syllabus docx wins on *policy*; Brightspace
wins on *what students actually see and submit*; `schedule.qmd` wins on *session-by-session dates*.
Where those three conflict with each other, the conflict is listed below rather than silently
resolved.

---

## A. Brightspace vs. the repo

From `_project_docs/BRIGHTSPACE_INVENTORY_2026F.md`. 62 live items reconciled.

| ID | Where | The conflict | Sev | Task |
|---|---|---|:--:|---|
| A1 | `final_project_milestone_reference.md` vs Brightspace | **M00 is a different deliverable.** Repo: *Group Contact Confirmation*, due Sun Sep 6. Brightspace: *Instructor and TA Meetings – Round 01 Schedule*, due Sep 20. Different task, two weeks apart. | 🔴 | #29 |
| A2 | same | **M04, M07, M13 are live.** The reference file says they are "not used this term" and "Do not renumber". All three are built, dated, and pointed at 26 groups. | 🔴 | #29 |
| A3 | same vs `SYLLABUS_OF_RECORD` + website | **The project grade split has no peer-review line.** Reference file: 40/20/40. Website + syllabus of record: 30/20/10/20/20. Brightspace has a live *Peer Review Submission* (Nov 15), which settles it against the reference file. | 🔴 | #29 |
| A4 | same | **M12 title.** Repo: *LinkedIn Post Invitation* (and the filename encodes the channel). Brightspace: *Post Invitation for Poster Presentation*. | ⚪ | #29 |
| A5 | `_final_project/2026F/` | **Five live items have no instruction file:** M04, M07, M13, *Peer Review Submission* (Nov 15), *Conference Poster Presentation* (Nov 17). Repo documents 13 items; Brightspace has 16. | 🔴 | #29 |
| A6 | `_quizzes/` | **Unknown which bank version is loaded.** Banks live only in `_quizzes/2026Summer/` with versioned CSVs (v1–v4); there is no `_quizzes/2026F/`. All 16 quizzes went live to students Aug 24. Every bank was rewritten in Aug 2026 for the CV doctrine, so a stale import would teach the retired CI-overlap rule and contradict the midterm. | 🔴 | #30 |
| A7 | repo | **Three participation-type quizzes have no repo content:** Group Check-in (Aug 28), Syllabus Quiz (Aug 30), Team Setup (Sep 20). | 🟡 | #31 |
| A8 | repo | **Three participation surveys have no repo content:** Profile Survey (Aug 30), Midterm Feedback (Sep 30), Reflection Survey (Dec 11). The Reflection Survey exists only inside retired `nb20`, unreachable by students. | 🟡 | #32 |
| A9 | `syllabus.qmd` vs Brightspace | **Extra-credit rules are not published.** Four live items (Mid-term Eval Oct 2, DataCamp Dec 4, Issues in Materials Dec 4, Final Eval Dec 11). `syllabus.qmd` carries only a stub pointer to Brightspace. DataCamp is worth **up to 5% of the course grade** and its "no two completions within two days" rule plus a Dec 4 deadline makes late awareness unrecoverable. | 🔴 | #33 |
| A10 | repo | **No peer-evaluation instrument exists.** Peer evaluation is 20% of the Final Project, 20% of the Competition, and 20% of Poster-to-Product. No rubric or rating form in the repo. | 🟡 | #34 |
| A11 | `_course_case_competition/2026F/` | **Unconfirmed coverage.** Brightspace has *Rank Code Submission* (Nov 29). Not verified that the instructions describe this deliverable rather than only the Kaggle leaderboard submission. | 🟡 | #35 |
| A12 | Brightspace | **Poster-to-Product has zero Brightspace items** despite being 5% of the grade: no deliverable dropbox, no showcase item, no peer evaluation. Either deliberate or never built. | 🟡 | #35 |

## B. Published site vs. sources of record

| ID | Where | The conflict | Sev | Task |
|---|---|---|:--:|---|
| B1 | `schedule.qmd:63` → published `docs/schedule.html` | The midterm coverage line still reads **"cross-validation with 95% CIs"**. That is retired claim W1 in `CV_INFERENCE_DOCTRINE.md`; the interval is descriptive, not a confidence interval. It is **live on the public website** and contradicts nb08, the rebuilt midterm banks, and nb00. | 🔴 | none |
| B2 | `schedule.qmd` vs `_announcements/2026F/upcoming_deadlines_and_key_dates.md` | **Thanksgiving span.** Schedule says Nov 25–28; the announcement says Nov 25–27. | ⚪ | none |

## C. Task tracker vs. reality

| ID | Where | The conflict | Sev | Task |
|---|---|---|:--:|---|
| C1 | tracker issue #10 | **Midterm date and coverage both stale.** Issue says "~Sep 23" covering "nb00–nb10". Reality: **Fri Sep 25**, covering **nb00–nb09**; nb10 is retired. | 🟡 | #10 |
| C2 | tracker issue #19 | **Milestone list built on the stale reference.** Lists M00 as Sep 6, states "skips M04/M07/M13", and enumerates 11 items where Brightspace has 16. | 🟡 | commented; blocked by #29 |
| C3 | tracker issue #3 | **Appears already complete.** "Build Brightspace course shell" (due Aug 21) — the export shows 62 items built, dated, and windowed. | ⚪ | close? |

## D. Repo-internal drift and tooling

| ID | Where | The conflict | Sev | Task |
|---|---|---|:--:|---|
| D1 | `CLAUDE.md` (6 references) | **Documented path does not exist.** CLAUDE.md points the instructor-page scripts and sync command at `_adm_stuff/_instructor_page/`; the real location is `_adm/_instructor_page/`. `_adm_stuff/` is gone. The documented sync command fails as written. The `p2p-research-program` memory carries the same stale prefix. | 🟡 | none |
| D2 | `scripts/sync_instructor_md.sh` | **Silently skips.** No `.venv` with `nbconvert`, so it exits without regenerating anything and `_notebook_lm/` has no nb00 markdown for NotebookLM. Failure is invisible unless the output is read. | ⚪ | none |
| D3 | `notebooks/` vs `CLAUDE.md` | **Narrative polish is incomplete.** CLAUDE.md states the nb08 Q&A pattern is "applied consistently across all 18 notebooks". Actual counts: nb00–nb07 have **zero**; nb08+ have 7–17 each. | ⚪ | none |

## E. Inside the official syllabus docx

Carried forward from `SYLLABUS_OF_RECORD_2026F.md`. These are contradictions *within* the document
of record, or between it and the site.

| ID | The conflict | Sev | Task |
|---|---|:--:|---|
| E1 | **The embedded schedule is the wrong offering.** The docx's "TENTATIVE COURSE SCHEDULE" is the Summer 2026 4-week intensive: "May 18 – June 12, 2026", Day 0–20, Colab links pointing at the `2026Summer_..._MGMT474` repo. Students reading the official syllabus get a May–June calendar and dead notebook links. | 🔴 | none |
| E2 | ~~Two contradictory Final Project sections~~ — **resolved.** The live *Peer Review Submission* in Brightspace confirms the later 30/20/10/20/20 version is operative (see A3). The docx should be cut down to that version. | ✅ | #29 |
| E3 | **Kaggle open date.** Docx says the competition opens **Aug 28**; the site and planning docs said **Aug 24**. nb00 now defers to Brightspace rather than printing either, but the docx/site contradiction itself is unresolved. | 🟡 | none |
| E4 | **Typo: "after August 248, 2026"** in the DataCamp extra-credit rule. It is the eligibility start date, so it should read Aug 24 or Aug 28 to match E3. | ⚪ | none |
| E5 | **Typo: "within 1 calendar days"** in the grade-challenge rule. | ⚪ | none |
| E6 | Office hours (Mon 2:30–3:30 EST) are in the docx; the site defers to Brightspace. **Intentional**, no action. | ✅ | — |
| E7 | The docx keeps the Poster-to-Product 80/20 and competition 20/60/20 breakdowns that the site dropped in the 2026-08-17 trim. **Intentional**, no action. | ✅ | — |
| E8 | Prerequisite (MGMT 305), section numbers, room (WTHR 114), the Kaggle invitation link, the poster-examples link, and the whole extra-credit section appear **only** in the docx. Noted so they are not lost. | ⚪ | A9 covers extra credit |

## F. Resolved during the 2026-08-18 to 2026-08-20 sessions

| ID | The conflict | How it was resolved |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | nb00 stated the midterm as **14** multiple-choice questions; the syllabus of record and `_midterm_exam/2026F/README.md` both say **15**, five alternatives each. | The paragraph was deleted from nb00 in the trim; Brightspace and the schedule already said 15. |
| F2 | nb00's Course Map advertised nb08 as "95% CI; **the CI-overlap rule**" and Module 2 as "k-fold CV with 95% confidence intervals" — retired claims W1 and W2. | Rewritten to descriptive fold intervals and paired per-fold comparison. **B1 is the same defect still live on the website.** |
| F3 | nb00's key-dates list was out of chronological order, and its schedule table carried a vestigial "Track" column that `schedule.qmd` had already dropped. | Resolved by deleting the calendar section. |
| F4 | nb00's arc table tagged nb05/nb09 as "Project Milestone 1/2" with no milestone list left to define them. | Tags dropped. |
| F5 | The nb00 video guide described the retired Summer 4-week/20-day format, `nb20` as the final notebook, and nb00 as a "Day 0 pre-course activity"; its cell index predated the calendar section. | Re-paced to Fall MWF and re-synced to the 18-cell notebook. |

## Resolution pass — 2026-08-20

Davi adjudicated every item on 2026-08-20. Status of each:

| ID | Decision | Status |

| A11 | Competition instructions vs. Rank Code Submission. | ⏳ open (**#35**) — next up |
| A12 | Grade item created by Davi; deliverable structure tracked as **#37 (High)**. | ⏳ open |
| B1 | Removed from `schedule.qmd`, `syllabus.qmd`, the midterm README, and the published site. | ⚠️ **docx still carries it** |
| B2 | Disregarded per Davi. | ➖ closed |
| C1 | #10 corrected to Fri Sep 25, coverage nb00–nb09. | ✅ done |
| C2 | #19 rebuilt to the 16-item track. | ✅ done |
| C3 | #3 closed as complete. | ✅ done |
| D1 | All `_adm_stuff/` references repointed to `_adm/`. **This was breaking the site build.** | ✅ done |

| E4 | "August 248" typo corrected. | ✅ verified |
| E5, E8 | Accepted as-is per Davi. | ➖ closed |

### What D1 actually broke

`_quarto.yml` pointed its post-render hook at `_adm_stuff/_instructor_page/scripts/postrender.sh`. Since that path stopped existing, **`quarto render` aborted every time**, which means the site had not been renderable since the rename. Two further stale paths were security-relevant: `encrypt_instructor_page.py` resolved the page password from the dead path, and the `pre-commit` guard read the same dead path to detect a staged file containing the password. A guard that reads a nonexistent file passes silently, so that protection had been off.

### Still open after this pass

1. **The syllabus docx still says "cross-validation with 95% confidence intervals"** (register item E9). Every other artifact is corrected, so the docx is now the only one carrying the retired claim. Not edited automatically because the file was open in Word. Suggested replacement: *"cross-validation and paired model comparison"*.
2. **The peer-review matrix assigns 33 groups**; Brightspace addresses the assignment to 26 groups on a 98-student roster. Filed verbatim and flagged in `final_project_peer_review_submission.md`; must be regenerated before publication.
3. **Two `[TBD]` survey links** (Reflection Survey, Midterm Feedback) and two placeholders in the peer-review instructions (`[Dropbox Folder Link]`, `[link]`).
4. **Round 01 meeting windows are inferred**, derived from the M00 and M04 deadlines to mirror the structure M07 states explicitly. Flagged in the reference file pending confirmation.


## Priority order for the open items

1. **A6** (quiz bank version) — quizzes went live Aug 24; a stale bank teaches a retired rule.
2. **A9** (extra-credit rules unpublished) — DataCamp's 5% becomes unearnable the longer it waits.
3. **A1–A3, A5** (milestone track) — corrupts the file every other document is told to follow; M01 opens Sep 9.
4. **B1** (95% CIs on the live site) — one line, one render, removes a public contradiction.
5. **E1** (wrong schedule inside the official syllabus) — students are reading a May–June calendar.
