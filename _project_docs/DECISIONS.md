# Course Design Decisions

This document records design decisions made during course development and the reasoning behind them. Decisions here are **load-bearing** — changing them requires deliberate review, not casual edits. New AI assistants and contributors should read this to understand WHY conventions exist before proposing changes.

---

## Decision 1: Flat Notebook Structure

**Decision:** All 21 notebooks live in `/notebooks/` (flat, not nested by week).

**Rationale:**
- Easier to link/reference (simple URLs).
- Clear sequential numbering (`nb00`–`nb20`).
- Students navigate linearly through days.
- GitHub displays flat lists better than nested directories.

---

## Decision 2: 60/20/20 Split for All Examples

**Decision:** Always use 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test.

**Rationale:**
- Consistency across all 21 notebooks.
- Students learn ONE splitting pattern.
- Sufficient validation data for tuning.
- Realistic test set size for course-scale datasets.

---

## Decision 3: `RANDOM_SEED = 474` Everywhere

**Decision:** All random operations use seed 474 (the course number, QM47400).

**Rationale:**
- Complete reproducibility — students get identical outputs.
- Easier to debug — same results every time.
- Course-specific seed (not the generic `42`).
- Memorable for students.

---

## Decision 4: Google Colab + Gemini (Not Local Jupyter)

**Decision:** Primary platform is Google Colab; AI assistance is Google Gemini.

**Rationale:**
- Zero setup for students (no installation issues).
- Consistent environment (same Python/library versions across all students).
- Built-in GPU access (for the deep-learning day).
- Gemini AI assistance integrated natively.
- Accessible from any device.

**Implication for notebook design:** Code must run in a fresh Colab runtime. No hardcoded local paths. Imports must be standard scientific-Python or pip-installable on first cell.

---

## Decision 5: Exclude Admin Materials from Git

**Decision:** `_adm_stuff/` is in `.gitignore`. Instructor notebooks (`*_instructor*.ipynb`) and `video_guides/` are also gitignored.

**Rationale:**
- Student privacy (contact info, accommodations).
- Sensitive data (grades, evaluations).
- Large files (homework solutions, zip archives).
- Public repo — cannot include private materials.
- Instructor solutions must not leak to students browsing the repo.

---

## Decision 6: Micro-Videos (≤12 min each)

**Decision:** All videos capped at 12 minutes maximum.

**Rationale:**
- Attention-span research suggests 10–15 min is optimal for instructional video.
- Mobile-friendly (students can watch on phone).
- Easy to re-watch specific topics.
- Forces concise, focused content.
- ~6 videos per day = ~1 hour total video, leaving time for hands-on notebook work.

---

## Decision 7: "PAUSE-AND-DO" (Not "Exercise" or "Assignment")

**Decision:** Use "PAUSE-AND-DO" terminology for the 10-minute in-notebook practice blocks.

**Rationale:**
- Clear action signal — pause the video, do this now.
- Distinguishes from graded assignments (which are separate).
- Emphasizes active learning over passive reading.
- 10-minute scope — not homework, not a project.
- Builds an engagement habit across all 21 notebooks.

## Decision 8: Instructor-First Notebook Editing Workflow

**Decision:** The instructor notebook (`nbNN_*_instructor.ipynb`) is the source of truth. The student notebook (`nbNN_*_student.ipynb`) is generated from it by copy-then-strip-`INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION`-cells.

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth — solutions and student version cannot drift.
- Solutions live next to the prompts they answer (easier to maintain).
- Student notebook is generated, never hand-edited; this guarantees the student version is always derivable.
- Allows last-minute solution polish without re-writing the student version separately.

**Implication:** Every cell that should be excluded from the student version MUST contain the literal string `INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION`. The strip script keys on this marker. Unmarked solution cells leak into the student notebook.

## Decision 9: CV-First Evaluation, Test-Set Locked Until nb14

**Decision:** From `nb09` onward, all model-performance claims come from cross-validation. The test set (`X_test`, `y_test`) is locked — no model evaluation touches it until `nb14`'s "Opening the Locked Test Set" ceremony.

**Rationale:**
- The test-set-lock ceremony in nb14 is pedagogically central. If the test set is touched 30 times beforehand, the ceremony loses meaning.
- Cross-validation is the professionally honest evaluation method; the course teaches it as the spine.
- Students learn that "I peeked at the test set 30 times before reporting accuracy" is the most common subtle leak in industry.

**Exceptions:**
- `nb14` cell 33 only — the one authorized test-set opening.
- `nb18` Kaggle-submission demo — uses `X_test` to simulate predicting on a held-out CSV (production-pipeline pattern, not model evaluation).

**Implication:** Before every commit in `nb09`–`nb20`, run `scripts/audit_cv_first.py`. The only acceptable hits are the nb14/nb18 exceptions.

---

## Decision 10: Narrative Polish Pattern (nb08 Style)

**Decision:** Every student-notebook markdown cell follows the nb08 narrative style — named business stakeholder in "Why This Matters", flowing prose over bullet lists, inline `"A question that often comes up here"` Q&A blocks, explicit section bridges, warm wrap-ups bridging to the next notebook.

**Rationale:**
- Students read notebooks alone, often late at night. The voice must be encouraging and complete, not skeletal.
- Named stakeholders (HomeValue CFO, MedScreen chief medical officer) make business framing concrete instead of abstract.
- Inline Q&A pre-empts the most common confusions, reducing "I'm stuck and don't know what to ask" moments.
- The `"A question that often comes up here"` phrase is grep-findable for tooling and audits.

**Implication:** New markdown cells longer than ~150 words should be checked against the polish pattern before commit. See `claude.md` for the polish helper script and the audit checklist.

## Decision 11: MC Option-Length Parity in All Assessments

**Decision:** In every multiple-choice question (quizzes, midterm, any future exam), all options must sit in the same length-and-elaboration band: every option ≥ 60% of the question's longest option, and per bank the correct option is strictly longest in ≤ 40% of questions (target ~25%, chance). Distractors carry their own flawed-but-specific rationale at the correct option's elaboration and connector-word density.

**Rationale:**
- In 2026Summer, correct options were authored as full decisions-with-rationale while distractors stayed terse. Two students independently reported (extra-credit program, 2026-06-12) that "always pick the longest option" scored ~100%. Hypothesis tests confirmed it: correct-is-longest in 96% of quiz questions (250 analyzed) and 99.5% of midterm questions (210 analyzed) vs. 25% chance, p < 10⁻¹²³; the midterm's connector-word density showed the same cue.
- Length-balanced, equally-elaborated distractors restore the assessments' validity: the only way to eliminate an option is to recognize the misconception it encodes.

**Exceptions:** none. Numeric/label options satisfy the band by formatting all options in the same shape (e.g., `k = 2` / `k = 100`).

**Implication:** Before importing any quiz/exam CSV to Brightspace, run `python scripts/audit_answer_length.py --file <csv>` — PASS is mandatory. Authoring spec: `scripts/_distractor_rewrite_instructions.md`; per-bank rules embedded in `_quizzes/2026Summer/quiz_generation_plan.md` §4.5 and `_midterm_exam/2026Summer/midterm_generation_plan.md` §5.6. All 48 quiz CSVs and 14 midterm case CSVs were rewritten to this standard on 2026-06-12.

## Decision 12: Fall 2026 — Midterm Dropped, Weights Reallocated, nb10 Retired (2026-08-14)

**Decision:** Effective with the Fall 2026 offering of QM47400:

1. **The midterm exam is dropped.** There is no midterm in Fall 2026.
2. **Its 20% is reallocated** — +10 points to the Course Case Competition (20% → 30%) and +10 points to the Final Project (35% → 45%). Participation (5%) and Quizzes (20%) are unchanged, so the weights are Participation 5% / Quizzes 20% / Course Case Competition (Kaggle) 30% / Final Project 45%.
3. **nb10 (the Midterm Casebook + Cheat Sheet) retires from the notebook arc**, which now runs to **twenty** notebooks — nb00–nb09 and nb11–nb20.
4. **Monday and Wednesday carry content; every Friday is a poster and/or competition studio.** The single exception is Fri Aug 28, which carries nb02.
5. **Lecture content completes Mon Oct 26** (nb17, Data Communication & Poster Design), leaving the calendar clear for the final poster.

**Rationale:**
- The full-semester format already assesses the same strategic reasoning the midterm tested — continuously, through the Kaggle competition and the twelve project milestones — so a one-shot in-person exam duplicated evidence the course was collecting anyway.
- Reallocating the 20% to the two authentic deliverables makes the grade track what the semester is actually built around: a deployed, reproducible predictive model and a poster defended in public.
- The Friday studio rhythm needs protected, recurring time. A midterm consumed a content session plus the review and consolidation sessions around it; dropping it is what makes the every-Friday studio pattern fit inside the Purdue calendar (Labor Day Sep 7, Fall break Oct 12–13, Thanksgiving break Nov 25–28).
- nb10 existed only to stage the midterm. Without the exam it has no successor to prepare, and its consolidation role is absorbed by nb09's Toolkit Recap and by the Friday studios.
- Finishing content on Mon Oct 26 gives every team two clear weeks to build the poster before it is due Tue Nov 10, ahead of the Fall Undergraduate Research Conference presentation on Tue Nov 17 and the Poster-to-Product sprint that follows.

**Exceptions:** none. The nb10 notebook files stay on disk for archival reference but are not taught, scheduled, or assessed in Fall 2026.

**Implication:** Decision 11 (MC option-length parity) remains fully in force — it now governs the quizzes and any future exam rather than a midterm. Grade weights are published in `syllabus.qmd`; the session-by-session sequence is in `schedule.qmd` and `_project_docs/MGMT47400_FullSemester_Plan_2026Fall.md`. Milestone due dates are unchanged by this decision (M00 Sep 6 through M11/M12 Nov 15).
