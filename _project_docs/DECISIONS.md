# Course Design Decisions

This document records design decisions made during course development and the reasoning behind them. Decisions here are **load-bearing** — changing them requires deliberate review, not casual edits. New AI assistants and contributors should read this to understand WHY conventions exist before proposing changes.

---

## Decision 1: Flat Notebook Structure

**Decision:** All 21 notebooks live in `/notebooks/` (flat, not nested by week).

**Rationale:**
- Easier to link/reference (simple URLs).
- Clear sequential numbering (`nb00`–`nb20`).
- Students navigate linearly through days.
- GitHub displays flat lists better than nested directories.

*Updated 2026-08-14: the arc is now 20 notebooks — `nb00`–`nb09` and `nb11`–`nb20` — after `nb10` was moved to `_archive/2026F_retired/`; see Decision 12. The flat structure itself is unchanged.*

---

## Decision 2: 60/20/20 Split for All Examples

**Decision:** Always use 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test.

**Rationale:**
- Consistency across all 21 notebooks.
- Students learn ONE splitting pattern.
- Sufficient validation data for tuning.
- Realistic test set size for course-scale datasets.

*Updated 2026-08-14: the arc is now 18 notebooks — see Decision 12. The 60/20/20 split still applies to every one of them.*

---

## Decision 3: `RANDOM_SEED = 474` Everywhere

**Decision:** All random operations use seed 474 (the course number, QM47400).

**Rationale:**
- Complete reproducibility — students get identical outputs.
- Easier to debug — same results every time.
- Course-specific seed (not the generic `42`).
- Memorable for students.

---

## Decision 4: Google Colab + Gemini (Not Local Jupyter)

**Decision:** Primary platform is Google Colab; AI assistance is Google Gemini.

**Rationale:**
- Zero setup for students (no installation issues).
- Consistent environment (same Python/library versions across all students).
- Built-in GPU access (for the deep-learning day).
- Gemini AI assistance integrated natively.
- Accessible from any device.

**Implication for notebook design:** Code must run in a fresh Colab runtime. No hardcoded local paths. Imports must be standard scientific-Python or pip-installable on first cell.

---

## Decision 5: Exclude Admin Materials from Git

**Decision:** `_adm_stuff/` is in `.gitignore`. Instructor notebooks (`*_instructor*.ipynb`) and `video_guides/` are also gitignored.

**Rationale:**
- Student privacy (contact info, accommodations).
- Sensitive data (grades, evaluations).
- Large files (homework solutions, zip archives).
- Public repo — cannot include private materials.
- Instructor solutions must not leak to students browsing the repo.

---

## Decision 6: Micro-Videos (≤12 min each)

**Decision:** All videos capped at 12 minutes maximum.

**Rationale:**
- Attention-span research suggests 10–15 min is optimal for instructional video.
- Mobile-friendly (students can watch on phone).
- Easy to re-watch specific topics.
- Forces concise, focused content.
- ~6 videos per day = ~1 hour total video, leaving time for hands-on notebook work.

---

## Decision 7: "PAUSE-AND-DO" (Not "Exercise" or "Assignment")

**Decision:** Use "PAUSE-AND-DO" terminology for the 10-minute in-notebook practice blocks.

**Rationale:**
- Clear action signal — pause the video, do this now.
- Distinguishes from graded assignments (which are separate).
- Emphasizes active learning over passive reading.
- 10-minute scope — not homework, not a project.
- Builds an engagement habit across all 21 notebooks.

*Updated 2026-08-14: the arc is now 18 notebooks — see Decision 12. PAUSE-AND-DO still runs across all of them.*

---

## Decision 8: Instructor-First Notebook Editing Workflow

**Decision:** The instructor notebook (`nbNN_*_instructor.ipynb`) is the source of truth. The student notebook (`nbNN_*_student.ipynb`) is generated from it by copy-then-strip-`INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION`-cells.

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth — solutions and student version cannot drift.
- Solutions live next to the prompts they answer (easier to maintain).
- Student notebook is generated, never hand-edited; this guarantees the student version is always derivable.
- Allows last-minute solution polish without re-writing the student version separately.

**Implication:** Every cell that should be excluded from the student version MUST contain the literal string `INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION`. The strip script keys on this marker. Unmarked solution cells leak into the student notebook.

---

## Decision 9: CV-First Evaluation, Test-Set Locked Until nb14

**Decision:** From `nb09` onward, all model-performance claims come from cross-validation. The test set (`X_test`, `y_test`) is locked — no model evaluation touches it until `nb14`'s "Opening the Locked Test Set" ceremony.

**Rationale:**
- The test-set-lock ceremony in nb14 is pedagogically central. If the test set is touched 30 times beforehand, the ceremony loses meaning.
- Cross-validation is the professionally honest evaluation method; the course teaches it as the spine.
- Students learn that "I peeked at the test set 30 times before reporting accuracy" is the most common subtle leak in industry.

**Exceptions:**
- `nb14` cells 30 and 34 only — the authorized test-set openings, **one per spine**: cell 30 is the classification business case, cell 34 the regression business case. Each test set still opens exactly ONCE; the singleness rule is preserved per case, not diluted across spines.
- `nb18` Kaggle-submission demo — uses `X_test` to simulate predicting on a held-out CSV (production-pipeline pattern, not model evaluation).

**Implication:** Before every commit in `nb09`–`nb20`, run `scripts/audit_cv_first.py`. The only acceptable hits are the nb14/nb18 exceptions.

---

## Decision 10: Narrative Polish Pattern (nb08 Style)

**Decision:** Every student-notebook markdown cell follows the nb08 narrative style — named business stakeholder in "Why This Matters", flowing prose over bullet lists, inline `"A question that often comes up here"` Q&A blocks, explicit section bridges, warm wrap-ups bridging to the next notebook.

**Rationale:**
- Students read notebooks alone, often late at night. The voice must be encouraging and complete, not skeletal.
- Named stakeholders (HomeValue CFO, MedScreen chief medical officer) make business framing concrete instead of abstract.
- Inline Q&A pre-empts the most common confusions, reducing "I'm stuck and don't know what to ask" moments.
- The `"A question that often comes up here"` phrase is grep-findable for tooling and audits.

**Implication:** New markdown cells longer than ~150 words should be checked against the polish pattern before commit. See `claude.md` for the polish helper script and the audit checklist.

---

## Decision 11: MC Option-Length Parity in All Assessments

**Decision:** In every multiple-choice question (quizzes, midterm, any future exam), all options must sit in the same length-and-elaboration band: every option ≥ 60% of the question's longest option, and per bank the correct option is strictly longest in ≤ 40% of questions (target ~25%, chance). Distractors carry their own flawed-but-specific rationale at the correct option's elaboration and connector-word density.

**Rationale:**
- In 2026Summer, correct options were authored as full decisions-with-rationale while distractors stayed terse. Two students independently reported (extra-credit program, 2026-06-12) that "always pick the longest option" scored ~100%. Hypothesis tests confirmed it: correct-is-longest in 96% of quiz questions (250 analyzed) and 99.5% of midterm questions (210 analyzed) vs. 25% chance, p < 10⁻¹²³; the midterm's connector-word density showed the same cue.
- Length-balanced, equally-elaborated distractors restore the assessments' validity: the only way to eliminate an option is to recognize the misconception it encodes.

**Exceptions:** none. Numeric/label options satisfy the band by formatting all options in the same shape (e.g., `k = 2` / `k = 100`).

**Implication:** Before importing any quiz/exam CSV to Brightspace, run `python scripts/audit_answer_length.py --file <csv>` — PASS is mandatory. Authoring spec: `scripts/_distractor_rewrite_instructions.md`; per-bank rules embedded in `_quizzes/2026Summer/quiz_generation_plan.md` §4.5 and `_midterm_exam/2026Summer/midterm_generation_plan.md` §5.6. All 48 quiz CSVs and 14 midterm case CSVs were rewritten to this standard on 2026-06-12.

## Decision 12: Fall 2026 — Midterm Dropped, Weights Reallocated, nb10 Retired (2026-08-14)

> **Superseded in part by Decision 13 (2026-08-15):** items 1, 2, 4, and 5 below no longer hold — the midterm is reinstated in class on paper, the weights are restructured, and nb18 runs once. Item 3 (nb10/nb15/nb20 retired) and the archival mechanics stand.

**Decision:** Effective with the Fall 2026 offering of QM47400:

1. **The midterm exam is dropped.** There is no midterm in Fall 2026.
2. **Its 20% is reallocated** — +10 points to the Course Case Competition (20% → 30%) and +10 points to the Final Project (35% → 45%). Participation (5%) and Quizzes (20%) are unchanged, so the weights are Participation 5% / Quizzes 20% / Course Case Competition (Kaggle) 30% / Final Project 45%.
3. **nb10 (the Midterm Casebook + Cheat Sheet) retires from the notebook arc.** As of 2026-08-14 **nb15 and nb20 retire as well**, leaving **eighteen** notebooks — nb00–nb09, nb11–nb14 and nb16–nb19.
4. **Monday and Wednesday carry content; every Friday is a Group Work session for the final project and the Course Case Competition.** Two Fridays are exceptions: Fri Aug 28 carries nb02 and Fri Sep 25 carries nb18's first pass.
5. **The last lecture session is Mon Oct 26** (nb17, Data Communication & Poster Design). **nb18 is taught twice** — Fri Sep 25 with linear models only, and Mon Oct 19 in full once the ensembles and nb14's protocol are in hand — and **nb19 moves to Wed Oct 21**, so all eighteen notebooks are covered by Mon Oct 26, leaving the calendar clear for the final poster.

**Rationale:**
- The full-semester format already assesses the same strategic reasoning the midterm tested — continuously, through the Kaggle competition and the twelve project milestones — so a one-shot in-person exam duplicated evidence the course was collecting anyway.
- Reallocating the 20% to the two authentic deliverables makes the grade track what the semester is actually built around: a deployed, reproducible predictive model and a poster defended in public.
- The Friday studio rhythm needs protected, recurring time. A midterm consumed a content session plus the review and consolidation sessions around it; dropping it is what makes the every-Friday studio pattern fit inside the Purdue calendar (Labor Day Sep 7, Fall break Oct 12–13, Thanksgiving break Nov 25–28).
- nb10 existed only to stage the midterm. Without the exam it has no successor to prepare, and its consolidation role is absorbed by nb09's Toolkit Recap and by the Friday studios.
- Finishing the lecture content on Mon Oct 26 gives every team two clear weeks to build the poster before it is due Tue Nov 10, ahead of the Fall Undergraduate Research Conference presentation on Tue Nov 17 and the Poster-to-Product sprint that follows.

**Exceptions:** none. The nb10 notebook files were moved out of `notebooks/` into `_archive/2026F_retired/` for archival reference — the student copy `git mv`'d and still tracked there, the instructor copy moved alongside it and gitignored by that folder's own `.gitignore` — and are not taught, scheduled, or assessed in Fall 2026.

**Implication:** Decision 11 (MC option-length parity) remains fully in force — it now governs the quizzes and any future exam rather than a midterm. Grade weights are published in `syllabus.qmd`; the session-by-session sequence is in `schedule.qmd` and `_project_docs/MGMT47400_FullSemester_Plan_2026Fall.md`. Milestone due dates are unchanged by this decision (M00 Sep 6 through M11/M12 Nov 15).

## Decision 13: Fall 2026 — Midterm Reinstated In Class (Paper), Weights Restructured, nb18 Single Session (2026-08-15)

**Decision:** Effective 2026-08-15, superseding Decision 12 items 1, 2, 4, and 5 (item 3 — nb10/nb15/nb20 retired — and the archival mechanics stand):

1. **The midterm exam is reinstated** as an **in-person, on-paper exam during class time on Fri Sep 25**, covering nb00–nb09. It is built **directly from the 2026Summer 14-case bank** (`_midterm_exam/2026F/`): per case form, **15 MC questions** (all fifteen Summer questions carried forward — kept, repaired, or replaced where they tested post-nb09 content or rested on a false premise), **five alternatives each** (a fifth length-parity distractor authored per question), 3 min/question = the full 45-minute window. nb10 (the Midterm Casebook) **stays retired**: the exam is administered from the case bank without a staging notebook.
2. **Weights:** Attendance 1% / Participation 4% / Quizzes 15% / **Midterm Exam 20%** / Course Case Competition 20% (20/60/20 internal split as in Summer; the peer-evaluation slice is 4 course points) / Final Project 35% (40/20/40 as in Summer; peer evaluation 7 course points) / **Poster-to-Product 5%** (80/20; peer evaluation 1 course point). Poster-to-Product becomes its own top-level grade line.
3. **nb18 is taught once, Mon Oct 19** — the full four-model pipeline in one session. The Round 01/Round 02 split (2026-08-14) is reverted in the notebook, the schedule, nb00/nb16/nb19 bridges, and the Brightspace pages (single `18_competition_workflow.md`).
4. **Fridays:** every Friday remains a Group Work session, with two exceptions — Fri Aug 28 (nb02) and **Fri Sep 25 (midterm exam)**.

**Rationale:** instructor decision to restore a summative in-person checkpoint on the mid-course toolkit while keeping the applied-work spine. The paper format avoids the online-integrity constraints Decision 11 documented, and five alternatives per question lower the guessing floor from 25% to 20%.

**Implication:** Decision 11 (MC option-length parity) applies to the 2026F midterm banks — every option ≥ 60% of the question's longest and correct-strictly-longest ≤ 40% per bank (chance is now 1/5). Grade weights are published in `syllabus.qmd`; the exam material lives in gitignored `_midterm_exam/2026F/` and syncs to the private instructor repo.

## Decision 14: Corrected CV-Inference Doctrine (2026-08-15)

**Decision:** The course's model-comparison rule changes. Three claims previously taught from `nb08` outward are retired as false: (1) that Student's *t* compensates for dependent folds — it only corrects for estimating the SD from few samples, and because folds share training rows the naive `s/sqrt(k)` interval is *optimistic*; (2) that overlapping marginal 95% CIs show two models are statistically indistinguishable — marginal-interval overlap is not a test of the paired difference; (3) that a test score landing INSIDE the CV interval confirms generalisation — a fold-mean interval is not a prediction interval for a different statistic on a different sample.

**What replaces them** (full spec, references, and authoring rules: `_project_docs/CV_INFERENCE_DOCTRINE.md` — binding):

1. The `mean ± t·s/√k` arithmetic stays, relabelled a **descriptive / approximate 95% interval**, with the dependence caveat stated once per notebook.
2. Model comparison = **paired per-fold differences on identical folds** (same splitter object, same seed) judged against a **predeclared practical-equivalence margin**, with three distinct outcomes: same sign + clears margin → real difference; signs flip → the comparison does not support a winner; same sign under the margin → practically equivalent, the simpler model wins (the parsimony tiebreak survives on honest grounds).
3. The nb14 ceremony's INSIDE/ABOVE/BELOW vocabulary survives as *description only*; deployment is judged against the predeclared business tolerance, never against the CV interval.

**Trigger:** An independent Codex `ultra` review of the Fall 2026 midterm traced invalid exam items to the teaching material itself (Bengio & Grandvalet 2004; Nadeau & Bengio 2003; Schenker & Gentleman 2001).

**Scope:** the 2026F midterm banks (rebuilt to the doctrine), 10 notebooks (nb02, nb06, nb08, nb09, nb11–nb14, nb16, nb18 — instructor copy first, per the instructor-first rule), 17 quiz banks with keyed options asserting the overlap rule, the video guides, and the Brightspace pages. Decision 9 (test-set lock) is unaffected and stands.

**Implication:** any new material that states a CV comparison rule must follow the doctrine file; its "Authoring rules" section (A1–A6: never assert an uncomputed number; keep the three outcomes distinct; declare the margin before results, once; prose and code move together; sweep whole notebooks, not mapped cells; instructor copy first) is part of the decision.
